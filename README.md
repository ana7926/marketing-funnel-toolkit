# Business Data Analysis Toolkit

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive toolkit built in Google Sheets, designed to help businesses analyze and optimize their marketing, financial, and payroll processes. It consists of three main components: **Marketing Funnels**, **Financial Analysis**, and **Salary Widget**. The primary goal of the marketing funnels section is to evaluate the performance of various customer acquisition sources, enabling businesses to identify high-performing channels for increased ad budget allocation and underperforming ones that may need reevaluation or discontinuation to avoid wasting resources.


## Project Structure
The project is divided into three parts:
1. **Marketing Funnels** 
   - Analyze the performance of different marketing channels to optimize ad spend.  
2. **Financial Analysis**  
   - Tools for assessing income, expenses, profitability and other necessary metrics for the good existence of a business.  
3. **Salary Widget**  
   - Calculate employee salaries, including taxes and bonuses. And most importantly, it shows the employee his current KPI performance and what needs to be done to increase his salary.

## Project Purpose & Business Value

This tool helps small businesses:

- 🧭 Track leads and conversions across multiple marketing channels.
- 🕵️‍♀️ Spot the most effective traffic sources and focus your efforts (because who has time for guesswork?).
- 💸 Calculate conversion rates and customer acquisition costs (CAC) to spend smarter, not harder.
- 🔍 Visualize sales funnel performance at every stage — from curious clicks to happy customers.
- 🚦 Detect bottlenecks (yes, we’re looking at you, leaky funnels) and spot areas for improvement.
- 🔮 Forecast future sales with data-driven magic.

By building this tool, I prove that I’m not just a data nerd — I’m a data nerd who understands how numbers translate to growth strategies and financial health for businesses!
